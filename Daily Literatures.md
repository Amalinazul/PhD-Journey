**Journal paper**: [Deeper Fine-Tuned Autoencoder for User Datagram Protocol Flooding
Network Traffic Detection in Internet of Things](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-2442056/v1/2e9544e4-f9c6-439e-85ca-ba8cab820ecf.pdf?c=1675440862), Ömer KASIM (  omerksm@gmail.com ), Kutahya Dumlupinar University: Kutahya Dumlupinar Universitesi https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4021-5412
- Idea: prefer **deeper model** for higher performance rather than shallow models, proposed a classification with high accuracy and performance can be performed by encoding the selected features deeper
- Datasets: N-BaIoT and NSL-KDD
- Attacks: **botnet** is User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flooding
- Model: Fine Tuned **Stacked Autoencoder**
- Result: Experiments in the study showed that the number of optimally selected features was significantly reduced, resulting in the lowest detection time. The accuracy, sensitivity, Cohen kappa, specificity and f1 score of the proposed model were quite high

**Conference paper**: [Attack Detection in IoT Using Machine Learning—A Survey](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.utm.my/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-18497-0_16)  , Saeed Ali Haifa Ali & J. Vakula Rani Conference paper First Online: 04 February 2023, [Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems and Internet of Things ICoICI 2022](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.utm.my/book/10.1007/978-3-031-18497-0)
- Idea: The goal of this paper is to provide a study on the attacks in IoT architectures such as the sensing layer, network layer, and application layer, then present ML and DL that contributed to the solution in attack detection. In addition, we discuss the challenges of IoT architectures.

**A book**: [Internet of Things - New Trends, Challenges and Hurdles](https://www.intechopen.com/books/11197)
- Idea: Written by leading experts in the field, this book serves as a showcase of the breadth of IoT research conducted in recent years for people who, while not experts in the field, do have prior knowledge of the IoT. The book also serves curious, non-technical readers, enabling them to understand necessary concepts and terminologies associated with the IoT.
- Audience: for how do have prior knowledge of the IoT
