Here is the place where I keep the daily notes I need for my PhD journey, including any notes about the work I've done, the work I want to do, the tasks related to the knowledge or work I've learned from my research, and any motivational ideas or methodologies I've read about or used.
I first recorded the notes using idea, but it didn't appear to be working very well, so I decided to try github.

Literature review is one of the daily tasks, therefore, here is the reference for daily literture review repo [Daily Literatures](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey/blob/main/Literatures%20Daily.md).
