Here is the place where I keep the daily notes I need for my PhD journey, including any notes about the work I've done, the work I want to do, the tasks related to the knowledge or work I've learned from my research, and any motivational ideas or methodologies I've read about or used.
I first recorded the notes using idea, but it didn't appear to be working very well, so I decided to try github.

Literature review is one of the daily tasks, therefore, here is the reference for daily literture review repo [Daily Literatures](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey/blob/main/Literatures%20Daily.md).

## 2023-03-05
1. Knowledge communication: Explore, try and write article with the info provided by supervisor on application using ChatGPT.
2. Research Implementation: TON-IoT pre-processing is still pending, need kick off ASAP.
3. Paper Writing: TBD.
4. Status: Paper submission, SLR submitted, just checked, under reviewing (10%).
5. Conference organized by prof, need to check if I can follow up with it with finished empirical conference paper.
6. A lazy ML tool need have a try.

## 2023-03-06
1. Article Review Request of [33171] From JIT.
2. Ideas of fog-based IDS, data splitting, FS and simple DL method, from a literature (Naeem Firdous Syed et al., 2023) can be refered for article.
3. Google dataset knowledge from prof.

## 2023-03-07
1. DONE! Submit SLR paper to another two journals, IJCNDS-144802 and IJICS-144797.
2. DONE! Finished peer review for JournalJournal on Internet of Things Paper ID 33171 Title Rapid COD Detection and Analysis for Industrial Internet of Things.
3. DONE! Finished three literature review paper, ideas updated in daily literature.
4. TBD: Conference paper need to be ready for Scopus conference organized by supervisor. Discussed with supervisor, prepare article first, then consider conference paper.
5. DONE! VSC+ChatGPT tried successfully, which seems more smooth than google colab + ChatGPT, an article shared in wechat platform, also discussed with prof.
6. Ongoing: Simple outline of the idea 1 article, ongoing now, focusing on TON-IoT data-preprocessing this week.

## 2023-03-08
1. Ongoing: The idea 1 article kicks off today, starting from methodology section, plan to finish data-preprocessing this week.
2. One paper literature review, rough review on IDS in SDN environment, can refer to this paper when discussing IDS in SDN.

## 2023-03-09
1. Literature review, roughly reviewed 3 papers, in which explainable AI and end-to-end DL can be the good candidate references.
2. Ongoing, no progress on idea-1 article and experiment today...
3. Done! Submit a paper to ùó™ùóøùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùó™ùóºùóøùó∏ùòÄùóµùóºùóΩ organized by UTM, waiting for response.
4. A journal [from Mala](https://ejournal.um.edu.my/index.php/MJCS) can be considered.

*1. APC fund of article submitted raised by prof. Done.*  
**2. Scholarship to be applied before 2023-03-30. Ongoing.**    
*3. Tried some application of chatgpt API, such as one key to write a complete book, very interesting. Done.*  
**4. Have to submit articles to WoS Q1, to come up with the publication result, even the fee is high.  Ongoing.  
5. Back to the progress of the idea 1 article, plan to finish experiment before 2023-03-30. Ongoing.**  
	- Few papers on Networking TON-IoT dataset.  
	- Furthermore, gap on missing value handling on TON-IoT dataset for many papers.  
	- So working on missing value handling feature by feature. 2023-03-20  
*7. The 4th semester course registration has been done today, and today is the first new day for the 4th semester of my PhD journey. Done.*  
*8. Daily progress update is needed starting from today. Done.*
